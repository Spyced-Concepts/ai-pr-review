## Why ai-pr-review

Most AI code review tools focus on code quality. This one leads with **security**.

Every review starts with a sensitive data disclosure scan — catching credentials, personal identifiers, private paths, and computer names before they reach your commit history. This criterion runs first, always, before any other finding is reported.

| | ai-pr-review | Typical AI review action |
|---|---|---|
| Sensitive data scan | ✅ First criterion, always | ✗ Not included |
| Free with existing GitHub account | ✅ GitHub Models | ✗ Requires paid AI subscription |
| Multiple providers (your key) | ✅ 5 providers + any OpenAI-compatible | Usually 1–2 |
| Custom scan rules | ✅ Add your own patterns | Rarely |
| MIT open source | ✅ | Sometimes |
| No dashboard or account required | ✅ | Often required |

## Review criteria

Every review checks these criteria in order:

1. **Sensitive data disclosure** *(security-first)* — credentials, API keys, personal information, file paths revealing usernames, computer/host names, private repo names. Severity-classified: Critical → High → Moderate. Always reported before any other finding.
2. **Merge conflicts** — immediate blocker
3. **Correctness** — edge cases, logic errors
4. **Cross-platform compatibility** — macOS, Linux, Windows (Git Bash)
5. **Bash quality** — `set -euo pipefail`, quoting, portability
6. **Security** — injection risks, unsafe variable expansion
7. **Code quality** — magic values, code smells, correct approach
8. **Dependencies** — external modules flagged
9. **Documentation** — docs updated alongside code changes
10. **PR scope** — single concern?

Add custom criteria via `review_criteria`. Add domain-specific sensitive data patterns via `custom_rules` (e.g. internal product names, employee identifiers).

Adding a new provider means implementing one function in a new adapter file. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Security and data handling

This action transmits only the PR diff and PR title/body to your chosen AI provider. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for:
- Exactly what data is transmitted
- Per-provider data handling policy links
- Your responsibilities when using with private or regulated codebases

**Important:** You are responsible for ensuring your use of this action — and the transmission of code content to third-party AI providers — complies with your applicable legal obligations, IP rights, and your provider's terms of service. See the [Data Handling Notice](LICENSE) in the licence.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). To add a new AI provider, implement `call_api()` in `scripts/adapters/<provider>.py` and add a setup guide in `docs/`. The adapter interface is fully documented.
