## Test scenarios

### UAT-001 — Valid diff, Anthropic provider

**Setup:** corvex-strike PR #3 — migration from inline script to action.

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow run completes without error | ✅ | 16 seconds |
| Review comment posted on PR | ✅ | Posted by github-actions[bot] |
| Comment contains `## AI Code Review` header | ✅ | No vendor branding |
| Comment ends with one of the three verdicts | ✅ | APPROVE WITH NOTES |
| `*Automated review. Maintainer approval required.*` footer present | ✅ | |

**Result:** ✅ Pass
**Notes:** Review content was high quality — correctly identified retry logic gap, truncation behaviour, and checkout step intent. No false positives.

---

### UAT-001c — Valid diff, GitHub Models (zero cost)

**Setup:** corvex-strike PR #3 — `ai_provider: github-models`, `ai_api_key: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`, `ai_model: gpt-4o`. No external API key.

**Bugs found and fixed during this scenario:**
- BUG-001: `models: read` permission required in workflow permissions block — fixed in `setup-github-models.md`
- BUG-002: GitHub Models uses `/chat/completions` not `/v1/chat/completions` — fixed by creating dedicated `github-models` adapter
- BUG-003: `importlib.import_module("adapters.github-models")` fails (hyphen invalid in Python module names) — fixed by normalising with `.replace("-", "_")` in `review.py`

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow run completes without error | ✅ | After 3 bug fixes; run 25609481561 |
| Review comment posted on PR | ✅ | Posted by github-actions[bot] |
| No external API key used | ✅ | GITHUB_TOKEN only |

**Result:** ✅ Pass (3 bugs found and fixed — all corrected in UAT branch)
**Notes:** Sensitive data scan ran correctly as criterion 1. GPT-4o via GitHub Models produced a well-structured review. Header `## AI Code Review` — no vendor branding.
