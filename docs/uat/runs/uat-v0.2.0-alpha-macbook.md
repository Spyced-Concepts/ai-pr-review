## Test scenarios

### UAT-001 — Valid diff, Anthropic provider

**Setup:** corvex-strike PR #3 — migration from inline script to action.

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow run completes without error | ✅ | 16 seconds |
| Review comment posted on PR | ✅ | Posted by github-actions[bot] |
| Comment contains `## AI Code Review` header | ✅ | No vendor branding |
| Comment ends with one of the three verdicts | ✅ | APPROVE WITH NOTES |
| `*Automated review. Maintainer approval required.*` footer present | ✅ | |

**Result:** ✅ Pass
**Notes:** Review content was high quality — correctly identified retry logic gap, truncation behaviour, and checkout step intent. No false positives.

---

### UAT-001c — Valid diff, GitHub Models (zero cost)

**Setup:** corvex-strike PR #3 — `ai_provider: github-models`, `ai_api_key: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`, `ai_model: gpt-4o`. No external API key.

**Bugs found and fixed during this scenario:**
- BUG-001: `models: read` permission required in workflow permissions block — fixed in `setup-github-models.md`
- BUG-002: GitHub Models uses `/chat/completions` not `/v1/chat/completions` — fixed by creating dedicated `github-models` adapter
- BUG-003: `importlib.import_module("adapters.github-models")` fails (hyphen invalid in Python module names) — fixed by normalising with `.replace("-", "_")` in `review.py`

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow run completes without error | ✅ | After 3 bug fixes; run 25609481561 |
| Review comment posted on PR | ✅ | Posted by github-actions[bot] |
| No external API key used | ✅ | GITHUB_TOKEN only |

**Result:** ✅ Pass (3 bugs found and fixed — all corrected in UAT branch)
**Notes:** Sensitive data scan ran correctly as criterion 1. GPT-4o via GitHub Models produced a well-structured review. Header `## AI Code Review` — no vendor branding.

---

### UAT-002 — Large diff truncation note

**Setup:** Set `diff_lines: 10` in corvex-strike workflow. Run 25609669842.

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow run completes without error | ✅ | 26 seconds |
| Truncation note present in comment | ✅ | `> Diff was large — review based on first 10 lines only.` |
| Note references the correct line limit (10) | ✅ | |

**Result:** ✅ Pass

---

### UAT-003 — Missing AI_API_KEY

**Setup:** Passed empty string as `ai_api_key` in workflow (run 25609713760).

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow fails (non-zero exit) | ✅ | 6 seconds |
| Error message clear and actionable | ✅ | `AI_API_KEY secret not configured` |
| No partial review posted | ✅ | |

**Result:** ✅ Pass

---

### UAT-004 — Missing AI_MODEL

**Setup:** Passed empty string as `ai_model` in workflow (run 25609732479).

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow fails (non-zero exit) | ✅ | 6 seconds |
| Error message clear and actionable | ✅ | `AI_MODEL variable not configured` |

**Result:** ✅ Pass

---

### UAT-005 — Invalid API key

**Setup:** Set `ai_api_key` to a syntactically valid but invalid key.

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow fails (non-zero exit) | ✅ | |
| HTTP error code visible in log | ✅ | `API HTTP error 401: authentication_error: invalid x-api-key` |
| No partial review posted | ✅ | |

**Result:** ✅ Pass

---

### UAT-006 — Unknown AI_PROVIDER value

**Setup:** Set `ai_provider: notarealai` in workflow.

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow fails (non-zero exit) | ✅ | |
| Error lists all supported providers | ✅ | `Supported: anthropic, gemini, github-models, openai` |

**Result:** ✅ Pass


### UAT-007 — Sensitive data detected in diff

**Setup:** Added `sk-ant-api03-DEVTEST...` as a comment in `packages/scanner/src/ai/index.ts`. Run 25610271335.

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Review comment posted | ✅ | |
| Sensitive data finding in criterion 1 | ✅ | `🚨 CRITICAL — Hardcoded API Key in Source Code` |
| Severity classified as Critical | ✅ | |
| Finding appears before other criteria | ✅ | First finding in review |

**Result:** ✅ Pass
**Notes:** AI named exact file and line, called it a blocker, recommended key rotation + git history scrub. Also noted the irony of the `review_criteria` stating "no hardcoded secrets".

**Cleanup:** ✅ Dummy credential removed in commit `13b7db7`; confirmed clean by grep.

---

### UAT-008 — PR body with shell metacharacters

**Setup:** PR body updated via API to include `$(echo injected)`, `` `date` ``, `$HOME`, `$(cat /etc/passwd)`. Run 25610347704.

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow run completes without error | ✅ | |
| No unexpected shell execution in logs | ✅ | Strings appear verbatim in logs — no command substitution |
| Review comment posted normally | ✅ | |

**Result:** ✅ Pass
**Notes:** PR body passed as env var to Python, not shell-interpolated. AI reviewer flagged the metacharacter content as a concern about injection safety — correctly noted it depends on the action's internal handling.

**Cleanup:** ✅ PR body restored to normal description after test.

---

### UAT-009 — Custom review criteria

**Setup:** Added UAT-009 custom criterion to `review_criteria`. Added a TODO with deadline and implementation detail to `ai/index.ts` to give the criterion something to flag.

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Review comment posted | ✅ | |
| Custom criterion visible in review | ✅ | `🟡 UAT-009 — Hardcoded TODO with Deadline` — named criterion, quoted line, classified High |

**Result:** ✅ Pass
**Notes:** First run (workflow change only) had nothing to flag — correct behaviour. Second run with a TODO containing a deadline fired the criterion precisely.

**Cleanup:** ✅ TODO removed from `ai/index.ts`; UAT-009 criterion removed from workflow in final cleanup commit.

---

### UAT-010 — Custom sensitive data rules

**Setup:** Added `custom_rules: "CORVEX_INTERNAL"` to workflow; added `// CORVEX_INTERNAL: ...` comment to `ai/index.ts`.

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Custom term flagged in review | ✅ | Flagged as leaking internal naming convention — blocker |
| Finding appears in criterion 1 section | ✅ | Raised under sensitive data / internal identifiers |

**Result:** ✅ Pass
**Notes:** AI correctly identified `CORVEX_INTERNAL` and flagged it regardless of whether it came from `custom_rules` or `review_criteria` — both inputs processed together.

**Cleanup:** ✅ `CORVEX_INTERNAL` removed from source and workflow in final cleanup commit `e19e405`; confirmed clean by grep.
