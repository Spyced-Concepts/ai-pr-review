# ReviewSentry — Test Suite

BDD-driven test suite for ReviewSentry. Tests are derived directly from the Gherkin feature files in `features/` and run in an isolated Python virtual environment.

---

## Quick start

```bash
cd tests
bash setup.sh          # creates .venv and installs pinned dependencies
.venv/bin/pytest -v    # Linux / macOS
.venv\Scripts\pytest -v  # Windows (Git Bash or PowerShell)
```

**Requirements:** Python 3.9 or later. No machine-wide package installs — everything runs inside `tests/.venv`.

Expected output:

```
19 passed, 22 skipped in 0.xx s
```

Skipped tests require a live GitHub Actions environment with a configured `AI_API_KEY` secret (end-to-end provider scenarios). They are not failures.

---

## Structure

```
tests/
  README.md               — this file
  requirements-dev.txt    — all dependencies, exact versions, no ranges
  setup.sh                — creates .venv and installs dependencies
  pytest.ini              — pytest configuration (testpaths, bdd_features_base_dir)
  conftest.py             — shared fixtures and step definitions
  test_transparency.py    — features/transparency.feature (10 static scenarios)
  test_criteria_config.py — features/criteria_config.feature (7 unit scenarios)
  test_core_review.py     — features/core_review.feature (validation scenarios only)
  test_input_safety.py    — features/input_safety.feature (static analysis)
  test_model_handling.py  — features/model_handling.feature (static + documentation)
  test_sensitive_data.py  — features/sensitive_data.feature (config + integration)
```

Feature files live at the repository root under `features/` and are the source of truth for all test scenarios. Tests are never written ahead of features — feature files are written first, then step definitions implement them.

---

## Development convention — BDD-first

All new ReviewSentry functionality must follow this order:

1. **Write the feature file first.** Define the scenario in Gherkin under `features/`. This is the specification and the acceptance test.
2. **Run the tests.** They will fail (step definitions not yet implemented or code not written). That failure is expected and correct.
3. **Implement the step definitions** in the relevant `tests/test_*.py` file.
4. **Implement the production code** until the tests pass.
5. **Commit.** The feature file, step definitions, and production code ship together.

---

## Dependency due diligence

All test dependencies have been individually assessed for security, maintenance, licensing, and geo-provenance before adoption. This section is the permanent record of that assessment.

**Assessment date:** 2026-05-15
**Assessed by:** Spyced Concepts Ltd.
**No unpatched CVEs were found in any of the versions listed below at the time of this assessment.** CVEs that existed in earlier versions of these packages have been fixed in the pinned versions specified in `requirements-dev.txt`.

These are **dev/test-only dependencies** — they are never bundled into the distributed action. They exist solely on developer machines and in CI test jobs. Production consumers of ReviewSentry are not exposed to these packages.

## Licence compatibility summary

All 14 packages use permissive licences (MIT, BSD variants, Apache 2.0, PSF). None carry copyleft requirements. All are compatible with ReviewSentry's MIT licence for development and distribution. Since these are dev/test-only dependencies and are never bundled into the distributed action, there is no licence propagation concern for end users of ReviewSentry.

| Licence | Packages |
|---|---|
| MIT | pytest, pytest-bdd, Mako, parse, parse_type, iniconfig, pluggy, six, typing_extensions |
| BSD (2 or 3-clause) | MarkupSafe, colorama, Pygments |
| Apache 2.0 | gherkin-official, packaging |
| PSF | typing_extensions |

## Attribution

The ReviewSentry test suite was designed and authored by Spyced Concepts Ltd. The BDD feature files and step definitions are original work. The test infrastructure relies on the open-source projects listed above, whose authors are credited in the package register.

We particularly acknowledge:

- **Alessio Bogon** and the original pytest-bdd authors **Oleg Pidsadnyi** and **Anatoly Bubenkov** — without pytest-bdd, running Gherkin feature files directly as Python tests would not be possible.
- **The pytest-dev organisation** — for maintaining the pytest ecosystem that makes structured, reproducible testing straightforward.
- **The Cucumber project** — for the Gherkin specification and the `gherkin-official` parser that enforces it.

If you are a maintainer of any of these packages and would like to know more about how ReviewSentry uses your work, we would love to hear from you.
